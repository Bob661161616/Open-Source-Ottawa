               Open Source Ottawa is a student-led initiative dedicated to promoting the adoption of open source software products in the Ottawa region. We seek to help developers and policy-makers alike understand the benefits of open source, and enhance technological innovation in Canada's capital. With a variety of plans to change the political, technological, and social attitudes towards open source, we aim to bridge the gap between open source and society.

				What is Open Source?
				<br><br>
				Put simply, open source software is code that is freely available for public use. This means that anyone can use, modify, and distribute the code for any purpose.
				<br><br>
				Why Use Open Source?
				<br><br>
				Open Source software provides a myriad of benefits, both to the companies that develop it, and to the users who use it.
				<br><br>
				For the company that produces the software, it allows them to receive feedback from the public, whether that be regarding bugs, security vulnerabilities, or any other issues. If the software is hosted on an online, public repository, like GitHub, users are easily able to file issues, as well as send their proposed changes to the company, called pull requests. This allows for the company to produce a much more secure and stable product, improving their profits as well as the experience of their users. An example of this in the real world is Linux. Due to being open source, its users are able to view the source code and locate vulnerabilities, referencing them in issues, or resolving the issue themselves through a pull request. Comparing this to Windows, its closed-source counterpart, these benefits are made much more apparent, as Windows lacks the public's feedback and solutions to bugs, resulting in slower software development and more bugs. 
				<br><br>
				For those who use the product, it allows them to take part in the development process, which is absent in closed source software. Additionally, by making the code available to the public, users will be able to see for themselves the internal details of the product they are using. This transparency allows for the user to verify that the product performs as advertised and isn't a virus.
